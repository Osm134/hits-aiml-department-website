# AIML Department Management System

A full-stack web application developed to manage and showcase the activities of the Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AIML) department.  
The system provides structured management of student clubs, internships, student representatives (CRs), and departmental updates through a modern, responsive interface.

## Project Overview

The AIML Department Management System is designed to help departments digitally manage student-centric information in an organized and scalable way.  
It allows administrators to create and manage clubs, internships, and student representative data, while students can view information and participate in activities.

This project follows a modular full-stack architecture with a clear separation of frontend and backend responsibilities.
